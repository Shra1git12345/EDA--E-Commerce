# EDA--E-Commerce
Suppose you are working as an analyst in an e-commerce company and have been given two data sets that contain the details of women’s apparel sold during the last year:

Dress Attribute dataset: This data set contains different features of women’s apparel.
Dress Sales dataset: This data set contains the number of sales for a particular dress ID on a particular date.
Let’s look into the first data set.
You can download the Dress Attribute dataset from the link provided .
In this data set, there are a total of 13 dress-related features.

Dress_ID: This represents the ID number of a particular dress. This is a unique identification number given to every dress.
Style: This represents the style of a particular dress according to the occasion, like a party or a vintage event.
Price: Each dress ID can fall in a particular price bucket, which can be low, medium or high.
Rating: This is the average rating given by the customers for a particular dress ID.
Size: The size column represents the majority of the size bought by customers for that particular dress ID in the previous sale.
Season: This depicts the season in which a particular dress is suitable, for example, summer, winter, etc.
NeckLine: This contains the type of neck in the dress, like V-neck, round-neck, etc.
SleeveLength: This represents the length of sleeves of the dresses: half sleeves, full sleeves, cap sleeves, etc.
Material: This contains information about the material that has been used to make the dress, like cotton, nylon, polyester, silk, etc.
FabricType: This contains information regarding the type of fabric of the dress, for example, chiffon, broadcloth, jersey, etc.
Decoration: This represents the kind of decoration around the dress, like ruffles, bow, embroidery, etc.
PatternType: This represents the type of pattern a particular dress has. Patterns may be solid colours, geometric designs, printed, patchwork, etc.
Recommendation: This is the target variable. Recommendation is based on the features and sales of the dress in the previous year. This is either 1 (means yes) or 0 (means no). This represents whether a particular dress is suitable for sale.

Now, let’s move to the second data set.


You can download the Dress Sales dataset from the link :
This particular data set represents the number of sales of a particular dress ID on a certain date, where columns represent the dates on which a particular dress ID has been sold.


Based on the above two data sets, you are expected to perform the EDA and draw useful insights from that. Based on the EDA analysis, answer the graded questions for this module.


You have gone through the data cleaning part with an example of the bank marketing dataset in the previous segments. Now, answer the following questions based on what you learnt in this session.


You are provided with a blank Jupyter Notebook with all comments to perform the operations.
